# slack-notify-apt-upgrade
Bash script to notify available apt upgrades via slack.

## How it works
The bash script simply retrieve new lists of packages via `apt-get update` and then calls `apt-get upgrade --simulate` to check for available upgrades.

If the result of the simulation looks like
```
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree
Reading state information... Done
0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 0 not upgraded.
```
we are done. If there would be more than "0 upgraded" packages, we'll send the Slack notification.

**Note:** You need to be `root` on your server because `apt-get update` must run as root.

## Installation
1. Save `slack-notify-apt-upgrade.sh` to your server, for example within `/root/scripts/`
2. `chmod u+x slack-notify-apt-upgrade.sh`
3. Create an incoming webhook for Slack (see https://api.slack.com/incoming-webhooks)
4. Open the script with your editor and update the configuration section:
    - your Slack webhook url
    - the slack channel to which the notification should be sent to
    - (optional) a username
5. As `root` user edit your cronjobs with `crontab -e` and add a line like this to call the script twice a day:

   `0 6,20 * * * /root/scripts/slack-notify-apt-upgrade.sh > /dev/null 2>&1`
   
That's it.

## Running it from cron.daily
Remeber to rename it and remove the .sh extension
The cronjobs in /etc/cron.hourly (and the other, similar directories) are executed by run-parts. run-parts is a little picky about filenames. By default it doesn't execute files whose filenames contain anything other than (all of those from ASCII)

uppercase letters
lowercase letters
digits
underscores
dashes ("minus signs")
So if your script has a filename of for example "myscript.sh", it just is ignored, because run-parts does not like the dot.

## Imaginable Extensions
- Modify the `color` attribute of the Slack message due to the existence of security related upgrades (at the moment it's always "danger").
- Cache the result of the simulation in a file to avoid resending the identical message over and over.
